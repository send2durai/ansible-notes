## This yaml file will play to identify the bunch of remote machines Uptime using ansible playbook,

---
 -  name: Check the remote hosts uptime
    hosts: localhost
    tasks:
      - name: Execute the uptime command over command module
        register: uptimeoutput
        command: "uptime"
      - debug:
          var: uptimeoutput.stdout_lines
          

#### Note: You can keep host group name in the hosts. I simply specified localhost in the host, why because i am running on my local machine.
