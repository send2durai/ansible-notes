### This playbook is written for getting disk usage as human readable format,


---
 - name: checking remote machine disk usage as a human readable format
   hosts: localhost
   tasks:
     - name: Execute the df command
       register: dfout
       command: "df -h"

     - debug:
         var: dfout.stdout_lines

## Note: I have tested in my local machine, hence i mentioned ad "localhost" in the hosts group.
